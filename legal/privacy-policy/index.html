                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>
                        We disable logs in our webserver configurations. We do not have access to any personal information unless directly provided
                        to us. We do not record any personal information that is provided to us unless there is a valid purpose to do so (Email/XMPP Communications, Cryto Donations).
                </p>
                
                <h2>Security of Your Personal Information</h2>
                <p>
                        If we receive personal information, we will protect it within acceptable means to prevent loss and theft,
                        as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                        We do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect 
                        personal information about children under 13.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</h2>
                <p>
                        We do not disclose any personal information unless required by legal subpoena.
                </p>
                <p>
                        We keep only the minimum required amount of personal information. This is to prevent
                        the disclosure of personal information to third parties in the event that it is required.
                </p>

                        You always retain the right to withhold personal information from us. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any 
                        of your rights over your personal information. If you do provide us with personal information you understand that we will collect, 
                        hold, use and disclose it in accordance with this privacy policy. You retain the right to request and/or remove details of any 
                        personal information we hold about you.
                </p>
                <p>
                        If we receive personal information about you from a third party, we will protect it as set out in this privacy policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Any personal information that is no longer needed will be deleted permanently within 1 hour.
